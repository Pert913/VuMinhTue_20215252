Q: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
A: Java is a always a Pass by Value programming language.

Q: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD)why does the title of these two objects still remain?
A: Because Java is a Pass by Value programming language, which means the method parameter values are copied
   to another variable and then the copied object is passed to the method. So the original titles of these 
   objects remain unchanged.

Q: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
A: This time we use a setter method to change the title of object directly.
